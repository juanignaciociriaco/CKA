Webhook
A Webhook is an HTTP callback, an HTTP POST that occurs when something happens; a simple event-notification via HTTP POST. A web application implementing Webhooks will POST a message to a URL when certain things happen.

To learn more about using the Webhook mode, see the Webhook Mode section of the Kubernetes Documentation.
