ABAC stands for Attribute Based Access Control. It was the first authorization model in Kubernetes that allowed 
administrators to implement the right policies. Today, RBAC is becoming the default authorization mode.

Policies are defined in a JSON file and referenced to by a kube-apiserver startup option:

--authorization-policy-file=my_policy.json

For example, the policy file shown below authorizes user Bob to read pods in the namespace foobar:

{
    "apiVersion": "abac.authorization.kubernetes.io/v1beta1",
    "kind": "Policy",
    "spec": {
        "user": "bob",
        "namespace": "foobar",
        "resource": "pods",
        "readonly": true     
    }
}

You can check other policy examples in the Kubernetes Documentation.
