Default Policy Example
The empty braces will match all Pods not selected by other NetworkPolicy and will not allow ingress traffic. 
Egress traffic would be unaffected by this policy.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingressâ€‹

With the potential for complex ingress and egress rules, it may be helpful to create multiple objects which include simple isolation rules 
and use easy to understand names and labels.

Some network plugins, such as WeaveNet, may require annotation of the Namespace. The following shows the setting of a DefaultDeny for the 
myns namespace:

kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myns
  annotations:
    net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy: |
     {
        "ingress": {
          "isolation": "DefaultDeny"
        }
     }
