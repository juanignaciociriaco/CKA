Authorization
Once a request is authenticated, it needs to be authorized to be able to proceed through the Kubernetes system and perform 
its intended action.

There are three main authorization modes and two global Deny/Allow settings. The three main modes are:

ABAC
RBAC
Webhook.
They can be configured as kube-apiserver startup options:

--authorization-mode=ABAC

--authorization-mode=RBAC

--authorization-mode=Webhook

--authorization-mode=AlwaysDeny

--authorization-mode=AlwaysAllow

The authorization modes implement policies to allow requests. Attributes of the requests are checked against the policies 
(e.g. user, group, namespace, verb).
