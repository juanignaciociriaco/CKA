Collocated Databases
The easiest way to gain higher availability is to use the kubeadm command and join at least two more cp servers to the cluster. 
The command is almost the same as a worker join except an additional --control-plane flag and a certificate-key. 
The key will probably need to be generated unless the other cp nodes are added within two hours of the cluster initialization.

Should a node fail, you would lose both a control plane and a database. As the database is the one object that cannot be rebuilt, 
this may not be an important issue.
