Exercise 13.1: Review Log File LocationsOverviewIn addition to various logs files and command output, you can usejournalctlto view logs from the node perspective.
We will view common locations of log files, then a command to view container logs.  
There are other logging options,such as the use of asidecarcontainer dedicated to loading the logs of another container in a pod.Whole cluster 
logging is not yet available with Kubernetes. 
Outside software is typically used, such asFluentd, part ofhttp://fluentd.org/, which is another member project of CNCF.io, like Kubernetes.
Take a quick look at the following log files and web sites. As server processes move from node level to running in containersthe logging also moves.1
.  If using asystemd.based Kubernetes cluster, view the node level logs forkubelet, the local Kubernetes agent.  
Eachnode will have different contents as this is node specific.
student@cp: ̃$ journalctl -u kubelet |less1<output_omitted>2.  
Major Kubernetes processes now run in containers. You can view them from the container or the pod perspective. 
Usethefindcommand to locate thekube-apiserverlog. Your output will be different, but will be very long.
student@cp: ̃$ sudo find / -name "*apiserver*log"
1/var/log/containers/kube-apiserver-cp_kube-system_kube-apiserver-4232d25701998f68b503e64d41dd786e657fc09504f13278044934d79a4019e3c.log3.
  Take a look at the log file.
  student@cp: ̃$ sudo less /var/log/containers/kube-apiserver-cp_kube-system_kube-apiserver-423d25701998f68b503e64d41dd786e657fc09504f13278044934d79a4019e3c.log

  4.  Search for and review other log files forcoredns,kube-proxy, and other cluster agents.
  5.  Ifnoton a Kubernetes cluster usingsystemdwhich collects logs viajournalctlyou can view the text files on the cpnode.
  (a)/var/log/kube-apiserver.logResponsible for serving the API
  (b)/var/log/kube-scheduler.logResponsible for making scheduling decisions
  (c)/var/log/kube-controller-manager.logController that manages replication controllers
  6./var/log/containersVarious container logs
  7./var/log/pods/More log files for current Pods.

  8.  Worker Nodes Files (on non-systemdsystems)
  (a)/var/log/kubelet.logResponsible for running containers on the node
  (b)/var/log/kube-proxy.logResponsible for service load balancing
