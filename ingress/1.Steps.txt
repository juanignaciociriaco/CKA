# Service Mesh

Service Mesh Options
Close Envoy
Envoy is a modular and extensible proxy favored due to its modular construction, open architecture and dedication to remaining unmonetized. It is often used as a data plane under other tools of a service mesh.

Close Istio
Istio is a powerful tool set which leverages Envoy proxies via a multi-component control plane. It is built to be platform-independent, and it can be used to make the service mesh flexible and feature-filled.

Close linkerd
linkerd is another service mesh, purposely built to be easy to deploy, fast, and ultralight.
